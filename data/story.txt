[player] I'm so tired.  Why do they keep me so late?

[player] I feel like I have a mountain of homework before bed.

[player] All I want do do is sleep, oh I better give up my seat.

[Old Lady] Children today are so rude! Not giving up your seat for an old lady.

[Old Lady] You should learn to respect your elders.

[player] But I was going to...

[Old Lady] Backtalk! such disrespect!

[Old Lady] You will learn true respect, you will learn fear!

[Old Lady] Your nightmares will haunt you! You will know fear.

[Old Lady] All of your friends, anyone who tries to help you, will DIE!

[Old Lady] And if your not quick, you will die to! (laughs)
