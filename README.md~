Survive your worst fears! The player faces a seamingly endless array of spooky scenarios.  It all started on that first night, when she went back to the school to get her cell phone from her locker. The classrooms where crawling with a shambling pear shaped monster.  After surviving her first "encounter", the player returned to school the next day to find everything was normal, like it never happened.  Except her friends.  Any friend who dies, seems to have never existed!  The next night ...

TODO's [code]
cut scenes
monsters get stuck on walls sometimes
attacks need to subtract action points.

set a flag where some monsters only move once spotted.  Better for "block your path senarios"
6 action points kind of drags the game in some longer levels, especially if you have already defeated opponents
  - increase action points?
  - give infinite action points until an encounter?
